## Hello I'm Paul!
## ** One of those humans that shouts “Design is not how it looks like, it’s how it works!” **

I'm a Product Designer based from Manila, Philippines. Crafting experiences from asking users to providing a solutions for them, digitally.  

Currently working as the head of product development of Qwikwire, One of the rising startups here in the Philippines. We do cross-border payments for real-estate.  

I'm helping to organize meetups for Figma here at the Philippines. First meetup for Figma held not just in the Philippines but in Asia. Also, I made a Figma version of the Value Proposition Canvas [**Download it here](https://www.figma.com/resources/assets/value-proposition-canvas/).**
